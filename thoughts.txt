thought in frontend
.->first  we use  usestate to  store data and manage all the data
->and useEffect to rendred all the data using a function
-> and using a asynchronus function to retrieve all the data from the backend]
->and lastly we return the userinterface using bootstrap and retrive all the task we input into the box,

thoughts in backend

and one for the delete particular item in controller file
->now we connecting to the database (MYSQL)using all the credientials
->and in the miiddleware we use SQL query to add ,retrieve and delete the data 
->and send them to frontend
